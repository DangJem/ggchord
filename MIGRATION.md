# Migrate to the ggchord candidate API

## Scope and timing {#scope}
These are current candidate replacements, not a v1.0.0 compatibility promise.
Earlier 0.16.x versions are locally completed but unreleased. Old calls in this
table explain migration and must not be executed as current examples. Exact
first-removal tags are not guessed where historical evidence gives only an upper bound.

## Replacement table {#table}
| Old (do not run) | Current | Removal / guard | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `geom_ribbon()` | `geom_link_ribbon()` | ≤ 0.16.1 | Renamed link layer; not ggplot2::geom_ribbon(). |
| `ggchord(..., rotation = 20)` | `ggchord(...) + coord_chord(rotation = 20)` | ≤ 0.16.1 | Global coordinates are composed with +. |
| `geom_feature(feature_shape = "block", feature_width = .05)` | `geom_feature(shape = "block", width = .05)` | 0.16.1 | Mapped feature_shape is retained. |
| `geom_gene(gene_offset = c("+" = .1, "-" = .2))` | `geom_gene(position = position_strand(c("+" = .1, "-" = -.2)))` | 0.16.1 | Explicit Position values are signed. |
| `geom_feature(feature_offset = .1)` | `geom_feature(position = position_strand(.1))` | 0.16.1 | Use a Position object. |
| `geom_gene(gene_width = .05)` | `geom_gene(width = .05)` | 0.16.1 | Fixed geometry uses the shared width name. |
| `geom_link_ribbon(ribbon_gap = .01)` | `geom_link_ribbon(link_gap = .01)` | 0.16.1 | Use link_gap; likewise use link_ctrl_point. |
| `geom_gene_label_repel(gene_label_layout = "aligned")` | `geom_gene_label_repel(label_layout = "auto")` | 0.16.1 | Migrate both the name and value. |
| `geom_gene_label_repel(label_rotation = 90)` | `geom_gene_label(label_rotation = 90)` | 0.16.4 guard | Previously ignored manual control now errors; alternatively remove it. |
| `geom_feature_label_repel(label_orientation = "horizontal")` | `geom_feature_label(label_orientation = "horizontal")` | 0.16.4 guard | Use the fixed feature-label layer for unknown-strand features. |
| `geom_restriction_site(leader = "trunk")` | `geom_restriction_site(leader = "radial")` | 0.16.1 | The radial default remains. |
| `theme_ggchord(base_size = 10)` | `theme_ggchord() + theme(text = element_text(size = 10))` | ≤ 0.16.1 | Text appearance belongs to theme elements. |

## Run the replacement {#replacement}
After [setup](README.md) and the `features` table in
[circular mode](README.md):


```r
p_migrated <- ggchord(plasmid_seq) + geom_seq() +
  geom_feature(data = features, shape = "block", width = .05) +
  geom_feature_label(data = features, label_rotation = 0) + coord_circular()
p_offsets <- ggchord(seqs, gene_data = genes) + geom_seq() +
  geom_gene(position = position_strand(c("+" = .1, "-" = -.2)))
```


Old minus-strand offset magnitudes need a negative sign in explicit Position
values. Mapping still uses `aes(feature_shape = type)` with a shape scale;
the fixed parameter is `shape`. Automatic labels use `label_layout`; manual
geometry uses the corresponding fixed-label layer. `label_layout = "aligned"`
becomes `"auto"`. Removed names are errors, not silently retained execution paths.

## What remains supported {#retained}
The five colour/color spelling aliases, all upstream reexports, gene/feature/plasmid
shortcuts and both geometry getter/export interfaces remain. Coordinate-specific
defaults and already documented result fields are retained. See the
API contract (`help("ggchord_api_contract", package = "ggchord")`) and current reference for
NULL/NA/missing semantics; NULL does not universally mean disabled.
